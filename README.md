# multithreaded-tcp-chat-server-client
by: SajadSojoudi@gmail.com

In this project, two chat server and chat client programs are to be developed. The chat server program runs on one system and different clients from the same system or other systems connect to it. On the client side, each client must first log in to the server and, if they do not have an account, register beforehand. After logging in, view a list of online users and request a chat to chat with them. When a chat request is sent, the target user's side should be notified in a simple way, which is requested by the user's chat request. If the answer to the chat request is positive, they will communicate and have a conversation, and if it is rejected, the conversation will not be established. Each user can chat with several people at the same time. At the end of each conversation, one party ends the chat and the other party is notified and the conversation ends.
Your hand is open on the server side. You can do whatever it takes to support how clients work in these scenarios.
